#' @title Calculate Spectral Indices For Individual Tree Crowns
#' @description Calculate one or more spectral indices for individual
#' tree crowns depicted in a polygon shapefile and a provided raster image and write the output optionally to a .shp
#' @param crown_SpatPoldf SpatialPolygonsDataFrame depicting crowns
#' @param extract_as_points Logical. Should the SpatialPolygons be converted to SpatialPoints before extracting pixel values?
#' This can be useful and save lots of time when the polygons are smaller than the cel size of the image. Default is FALSE.
#' @param r_fname Raster file of the image to calculate the spectral index from.
#' The bands of the raster should be named following the Quantalab convention *X700.000000.Nanometers*
#' @param index_names Character vector with the names of a spectral indices implemented as a function in CanHeMonR. e.g. "G_over_B".
#' If left to NULL (the default) and all_bands is T, then only the average band values, and no indices are returned. This is useful when
#' extracting values from a DEM image for example.
#' @param all_bands Logical. Should individual band values be returned? Default = T
#' @param bandnames Character. In case the bands aren't named according to wavelength and following csic convention, they
#' can be provided. Default is NULL in which cases bandnames are read from the image file and csic naming convention is assumed.
#' @param shp_outname Filename for a shapefile of the output. If NULL, no output file is written away. Default is NULL.
#' @return A point shapefile with attribute table, and the points placed at the centroid of each crown.
#' The attribute table of the shp file maintains the attribute table of the crown but adds a column for each spectral index.
