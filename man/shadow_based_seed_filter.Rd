\usage{
shadow_based_seed_filter(seed_shp_fname, image_fname, shadow_mask, x_shift,
  y_shift, shadow_diameter = 6, bandnames = NULL, outp_seed_shp_fname)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed_shp_fname}{Character. Filename for the input point shapefile.}

\item{image_fname}{Filename of the image to run the tree detection on}

\item{shadow_mask}{List. Uneven positions should provide index names or wavelength numbers. Even positions in the list
should provide the cut-off value of the spectral index, below which, pixels are considered shadow.
Default is list('NDVI',0,1).}

\item{x_shift}{Numeric. Horizontal shift from crown to shadow in x_direction.}

\item{y_shift}{Numeric. Horizontal shift from crown to shadow in y_direction.}

\item{shadow_diameter}{Numeric. Maximum diameter of a crown. Default is 6 m.}

\item{bandnames}{Character. In case the bands aren't named according to wavelength and following csic convention, they
can be provided. Default is NULL in which cases bandnames are read from the image file and csic naming convention is assumed.}

\item{outp_seed_shp_fname}{Character. Filename for the output point shapefile. Default is NA, which means output is not written away.}
